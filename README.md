# archive-academic-java-*
That repositories gather files and projects related to IT/Computer Science from years 2013-2016 during my studies. Projects are on gratuate / junior level and might not reflect my present skills.
However, they helped me learning Java previously and still have big value today. Moreover, two theses (academic long essays) and two conferences I had a speech to definitely emphasise my dedication and interests in Computer Science.

Since most of materials and programs were written in Polish, I segragated files that might be read my non-Polish readers and Polish readers. Therefore I have two repositories:
* archive-academic-java-pl
* archive-academic-java-en

# archive-academic-java-pl
This repository contains:
* KNITS_2014 and KNITS_2015 - presentation files during my speeches
* 'praca_inzynierska' / 'praca_licencjacka_forum' - two theses. Second also includes working application
* shopping_lists - the application on Adroid devices that enables CRUD operation on products and shopping lists
* student_schedule - a simple project that uses jQuery, Drag'n Drop and Bootstrap

All projects have separate readme.txt files.
